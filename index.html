  Meeting fellow makers is incredible feeling.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re in a city like San Francisco or New York, that’s easy, but the hacker spirit is everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  This summer, we’re hitting the the road. In our converted minibus, we’ll visit 50 cities in approximately 90 days.
</p>
<p>
  At each city we’ll run a pop-up hackathon, unconference, or demo session. We’ll get together in a park or a similar public space, there’ll be free food, good vibes, and awesome people.
</p>
<p>
  For now, we’re working things out so expect more details. If you’d be interested in helping, drop us an email at email@email.com. And, if you’ve got the ability to support financially, we’re raising money at [hcb.hackclub.com/slug](https://hcb.hackclub.com/slug).

<p>
  See you on the road,
